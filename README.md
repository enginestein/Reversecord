# Reversecord

A repository containing reverse engineered discord code. For now the route to recompile it is not figured out, but I will be working on it. 

# Documentation

`app` folder contains the source of main application and `common` folder contains all the utility functions for the discord application. 

use `npm` to install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enginestein/Reversecord.git
cd Reversecord
npm install
```

Now, there are other helping folders that contains code for rich feaures of discord besides just texting, for example discord webhooks.

- Cloudsync
